## Best Search Method in an Array

- **Linear Search** is the simplest method where each element is checked one by one. It works on both sorted and unsorted arrays and is useful for small datasets or when the array is unsorted. However, it is inefficient for large arrays due to its O(n) time complexity, especially when the element is near the end or not present.

- **Binary Search** is a much faster technique with O(log n) time complexity, but it only works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the array into halves to find the target element. This makes it ideal for large datasets where the array is already sorted or can be sorted beforehand. It is very efficient for one-time or occasional searches.



###  Conclusion:

- For a **one-time search on unsorted data**, use **Linear Search**.
- For a **one-time search on sorted data**, use **Binary Search**.
