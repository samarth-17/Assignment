## Best Way to Reverse a String in Java

The best and most recommended way to reverse a string in Java is by using the `StringBuilder.reverse()` method. It is fast, simple, and internally optimized for performance. This method uses a character array and swaps characters efficiently, just like manual approaches, but with cleaner code and fewer chances of errors. It requires only one line of code and is easy to read and maintain.
